Yooooo. My buddy was doing a playoffs fantasy football game in excel. YEESH. So I made a pretty sweet Fantasy Football website. It's for the playoffs. YOU CAN PLAY FANTASY FOOTBALL DURING THE NFL PLAYOFFS. 

There's a lot of React Springs. It looks sweet. It really does. 

If you're considering hiring me, there's a __tests__ folder. That's also crazy sweet. 

It's in Beta right now. Is there a step before Beta? Because that's where it's at. 

I'm happy to collaborate. 

I'm happy to chat about plugging in a Firebase real-time database. 

Oh, I also do UX research. So here's the task flow:

Sign up -> Create Team -> View / Customize Your Team -> Add Team To League -> See How Your Team Does _live_ While Watching Football.

If you wanna take this to the next level, let me know. Super down for the open source.
